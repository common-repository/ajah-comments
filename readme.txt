This plugin is no longer supported or maintained.

Optimizes your Wordpress blog for Search Engines (Search Engine Optimization).

== Description ==

This gives you paged comments with Ajax/[Ajah](http://wp.uberdose.com/2007/08/19/ajah-and-ajax/).
You can define how many comments get shown per page.
With 'Older' and 'Newer' you can quickly skim through older comments without page reloads.

This is very useful for posts with huge numbers of comments.
Only the latest comments get shown initially which makes the post load much faster.

You can see it in action [here on my SEO plugin post](http://wp.uberdose.com/2007/03/24/all-in-one-seo-pack/#comments).

== Installation ==

1. Unzip into your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. If you're uploading it make sure to upload
the top-level folder. Don't just upload all the php files and put them in `/wp-content/plugins/`.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. That's it!
